# PyTorch Scholarship Challenge from Facebook

See [here](https://www.udacity.com/facebook-pytorch-scholarship) for more information.

The `Image_Classifier_Project.ipynb` was trained at Google Colab's GPU. Thus, the environment should replicate that.

Scripts in `src/` corresponding to the functions used in the notebook. Scripts will have to be modified under `if __name__ = __main___` params dictionary before running `argparse` was not used; whereas utils are stored in `src.utils`. To run scripts, type `python -m src.<script name>`.

## Packages required

- PIL
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- numpy
- torch
